* This python script is essentially a BMI calculator, but instead of outputting the BMI, it just tells the user if they're underweight, normal, overweight or obese
* This program is heavily reliant on if, elif, and else statements. At the time of writing this program, I am still a beginner in python so my knowledge and computational skills are somewhat rudimentary
